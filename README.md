Project Description

Ultron is a basic C# console chatbot developed to raise awareness about cybersecurity. 

Technologies Used

- C# (Console Application)
- .NET Framework 4.0.8
- Visual Studio Code  2022
- ASCII Art 
- WAV audio (for voice greeting)

User Guide

1: When you run the application:
   - A voice greeting in the format of a .wav file will play.
   - If the system does not find the audio, an error message will be displayed.

2: While the .wav audio plays, the logo will be shown.
   - The logo is an image of a robot generated in ASCII.
   - If the logo or image is not found, an error message will be displayed, or the system will replace the path.

3: The system will greet you with the following text image:
     "Ultron the CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS BOT"

4: After the banner, the system will prompt you for your name.
   - This name will be used to address you during all interactions with the chatbot.

5: After asking for your name, you can ask the chatbot questions on cybersecurity topics, such as:
   - Password safety
   - Phishing
   - Safe browsing
   - And more

6: Example of an interaction:
User: How can I improve my password security?
Ultron: Always use a strong password with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Never reuse passwords!

7: If you ask about something the chatbot hasn't been trained on, it will respond with a message saying it can only assist with cybersecurity-related topics.
   - This ensures the chatbot will guide you to focus on the intended topics.

8: If the user submits empty input, the chatbot will ask for valid input.
   
9: To exit the application, simply type "exit."
    - The system will then display a friendly exit message and ask the user to press any key to close the application.
Key Features added in Part Two

- Keyword Recognition:
The chatbot can respond naturally to a variety of keywords, such as "password," "phishing," "virus," etc. It provides engaging responses based on the context of the user’s query.

- Random Responses:
The chatbot can generate random responses from predefined lists for topics like password security, phishing, and viruses. This ensures varied and dynamic interactions.

- Conversation Flow:
The conversation is designed to flow seamlessly, with prompts guiding the user through cybersecurity topics. The chatbot transitions naturally from one topic to another, making the experience more engaging.

- Memory and Recall:
The chatbot can remember the user’s name and their previous interactions, enhancing the personal experience.

- Sentiment Detection:
The chatbot can detect the user's emotional tone by analyzing their input for positive or negative words (e.g., "happy," "sad," "excited"). Based on this, the chatbot tailors its responses to suit the user's mood. For example, if a user expresses sadness, the chatbot will offer comforting words.
